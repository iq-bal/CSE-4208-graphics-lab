1 Introduction
1.1 Project Overview
This project aims to design and develop an immersive Ancient Egyptian Tomb Explo-
ration simulation using OpenGL. The virtual environment represents a “T-shaped” burial
chamber containing corridors, transverse halls, pillars, and an interactive sarcophagus.
This architectural design is historically accurate and represents the typical layout found
in Egyptian royal tombs from the New Kingdom period (circa 1550-1077 BCE). The
project demonstrates core computer graphics concepts such as hierarchical modeling,
matrix stacks, point light attenuation, and normal mapping. All objects in the scene are
constructed directly inC++code using basic geometric primitives, showcasing the power
of procedural geometry generation without relying on external 3D modeling software.
1.2 Motivation and Objectives
The primary motivation for this project is to create an engaging interactive experience
while demonstrating fundamental computer graphics principles. The Egyptian tomb
setting provides a rich visual context that allows for the implementation of complex
lighting scenarios, texture mapping on ancient stone surfaces, and atmospheric rendering
techniques.Key objectives include:
•Implementing a complete real-time 3D rendering pipeline using modern OpenGL
•Demonstrating hierarchical transformations and scene graph management
•Creating realistic lighting with multiple point light sources and attenuation
•Developing interactive elements that respond to user input
•Applying texture mapping and normal mapping for enhanced visual fidelity
•Building a first-person camera system with smooth navigation controls
1.3 Scope and Limitations
The project focuses on rendering and interaction mechanics rather than game logic or
narrative elements. Physics simulation is limited to basic collision detection for navi-
gation boundaries. Advanced rendering techniques such as shadow mapping, ambient
occlusion, and global illumination are beyond the current scope but may be implemented
as future enhancements. The environment is designed as a single continuous space rather
than multiple loaded levels, which simplifies memory management and state transitions.
All assets are generated procedurally or loaded from standard image formats, ensuring
portability across different development environments.

Table 1: Primary libraries and their roles
2.2 Development Environment
The project is developed usingC++17standards with cross-platform compatibility in
mind. The build system utilizes CMake for managing compilation across Windows, ma-
cOS, and Linux environments. Version control is maintained through Git, enabling col-
laborative development and iterative refinement. The shader code is written in GLSL
(OpenGL Shading Language) version 3.30, matching the core OpenGL profile. All tex-
ture assets are stored in PNG format to ensure lossless quality and transparency support
where needed.
3 Project Visuals
Figures 1 through 4 showcase the visual design and lighting of the proposed 3D envi-
ronment. The exterior pyramid structure serves as the entry point, while the isometric
view demonstrates the spatial relationships between different chambers and corridors.
The lighting showcases highlight the atmospheric qualities achieved through careful light
placement and attenuation parameters. The tomb’s architecture follows authentic Egyp-
tian design principles, with a descending entrance corridor leading to a pillared hall, which
then opens into the main burial chamber. Hieroglyphic wall decorations are rendered us-
ing normal-mapped textures to simulate carved relief without the geometric complexity
of actual 3D carving.

4 Dynamic Interaction Objects
4.1 Game Object & Mechanics Overview
The interactive elements within the tomb create an engaging exploration experience that
goes beyond passive observation. Each dynamic object serves both aesthetic and game-
play purposes, contributing to the overall atmosphere while demonstrating advanced
graphics programming techniques.
1. Swinging Blade Trap Role:Hazards requiring timed movement to bypass, adding
challenge to corridor navigation.Implementation:The blade trap utilizes time-based
sinusoidal rotation using a matrix stack to handle pivot points accurately. The transfor-
mation hierarchy consists of:
1. Ceiling mount (parent transformation)
2. Pendulum arm (child with animated rotation)
3. Blade geometry (grandchild inheriting all transformations)
The rotation angle follows the equation:θ(t) =θ maxsin(2πft), whereθ maxis the maxi-
mum swing angle (typically 45 degrees) andfis the frequency of oscillation. This creates
a smooth, physically plausible motion pattern that players can learn to anticipate.
2. First-Person Camera System Role:Interactive exploration of the tomb envi-
ronment with intuitive controls.Controls:WASD keys for movement (forward, left,

design with main corridor, transverse hall, and burial chamber

momentum-based movement for smooth acceleration and deceleration, preventing jar-
ring stops and starts.Technical Details:The camera maintains three perpendicular
vectors (forward, right, up) that are recalculated each frame based on mouse input. Move-
ment speed is modulated by frame time to ensure consistent velocity regardless of frame
rate variations. Pitch rotation is clamped to prevent gimbal lock, restricting vertical look
angle to approximately±89 degrees.

4.2 Interactive Features
3. Interactive Sarcophagus Role:The final objective within the burial chamber,
serving as the focal point of the exploration experience.Interaction:Key-press (E key)
triggers lid translation along its local Y-axis when the player is within interaction range
(defined as 2.5 units from the sarcophagus center). The lid slides smoothly using linear
interpolation over 2 seconds, revealing the interior. A proximity detection system uses
distance calculation:d=p
(xp−x s)2+ (y p−y s)2+ (z p−z s)2where (x p, yp, zp) is the
player position and (x s, ys, zs) is the sarcophagus position.Visual Feedback:When
within interaction range, the sarcophagus glows subtly (achieved through increased emis-
sive color in the fragment shader), providing clear feedback to the player that interaction
is possible. This prevents frustration from unclear interaction boundaries.
4. Torchlight System Features:Multiple point lights strategically positioned along
corridors and chambers, each with quadratic attenuation to simulate realistic light falloff.
Attenuation Formula:Light intensity follows the equation:
I=I0
Kc+K ld+K qd2
whereI 0is the base intensity,dis distance from light source, andK c,K l,K qare con-
stant, linear, and quadratic attenuation coefficients respectively. Typical values used:
Kc= 1.0,K l= 0.09,K q= 0.032 for medium-range torchlight.Flickering Effect:
Each torch implements a Perlin noise-based flicker using time-varying intensity modula-
tion in the fragment shader. This creates natural-looking flame movement without the
computational cost of particle systems:I final=I base·(1.0 + 0.1·noise(t)).

5 Objects with Complex Shapes
5.1 Hierarchical Modeling Approach
All complex objects in the tomb are constructed using hierarchical modeling principles.
This approach treats complicated structures as assemblies of simpler components orga-
nized in parent-child relationships. Basic primitives such as cubes, cylinders, and pyra-
mids are reused with different transformations, demonstrating efficient geometry man-
agement. The hierarchical structure offers several advantages:
•Transform Propagation:Child objects automatically inherit parent transforma-
tions
•Code Reusability:Base primitives are defined once and instantiated multiple times
•Logical Organization:Complex objects are conceptually divided into meaningful
components
•Simplified Animation:Animating a parent automatically affects all children ap-
propriately
The matrix stack implementation uses GLM’s transformation functions combined with
explicit push/pop operations to maintain transformation context. Each object’s local
transformation is multiplied with its parent’s accumulated transformation to produce the
final world-space position and orientation.

5.2 Implementation Details
1. Corridor Pillars Why it is complex:Requires instanced rendering of repetitive
tapered structures with decorative capitals and bases, positioned at regular intervals along
the corridor.Implementation:Each pillar consists of three main components:
1.Base:A wider cuboid providing stability (1.5 unit width)
2.Shaft:Multiple stacked cuboids with decreasing scale factors to create tapering
effect. Each section is 0.98 times the width of the section below it, creating a smooth
taper from 1.2 units at bottom to 0.8 units at top over 6 units of height.
3.Capital:A decorative top element with lotus-inspired geometry (wider than shaft,
1.3 units)
Instancing is achieved through a loop that positions identical pillar assemblies at intervals
of 8 units along the corridor’s length. Each instance shares the same vertex buffer object
(VBO) but has a unique model matrix, significantly reducing memory usage and draw
calls compared to creating separate geometry for each pillar.
8
2. Pendulum Traps Why it is complex:Multiple articulated parts (ceiling mount,
suspension chain, pendulum arm, blade) that must move in synchronized motion while
maintaining correct spatial relationships.Implementation:The hierarchical structure
is organized as follows:Parent:Ceiling beam (stationary, defines global position)
•Fixed horizontal beam spanning ceiling width (0.3×0.3×4 units)
•Serves as anchor point for all moving components
Child 1:Pendulum arm (animated rotation)
•Long narrow cylinder (0.1 unit radius, 3 units length)
•Rotation pivot at top, connecting to ceiling beam
•Oscillates according to time-based sine function
Grandchild:Blade attachment (inherits arm rotation)
•Large flat rectangular prism (2×0.1×0.5 units)
•Positioned at bottom of pendulum arm
•Metallic texture with specular highlights to emphasize danger
The transformation chain multiplies matrices in the order:M world =M ceiling·Mrotation (t)·
Marm·Mblade, ensuring that the blade maintains proper orientation relative to the swinging
arm regardless of rotation angle.
3. Hieroglyphic Walls Why it is complex:Requires depth simulation on flat sur-
faces to create the illusion of carved reliefs without the geometric complexity of actual
3D carving. This technique is essential for achieving visual richness while maintaining
rendering performance.Implementation:Walls are modeled as scaled cuboids (typi-
cally 0.2×8×6 units for a corridor wall segment) with carefully crafted texture and
normal maps. The normal mapping technique uses tangent-space calculations to perturb
surface normals based on the normal map’s RGB values, creating the illusion of surface
detail.TBN Matrix Construction:For each vertex, three vectors are calculated:
•T (Tangent):Aligned with texture U coordinate direction
•B (Bitangent):Aligned with texture V coordinate direction
•N (Normal):Perpendicular to surface
The TBN matrix transforms normal map data from tangent space to world space:N world =
TBN·N tangent , whereN tangent is the normal read from the texture (2·RGB−1 to convert
from [0,1] to [-1,1] range).

4. The Sarcophagus Why it is complex:Multi-part assembly representing one of
the most detailed objects in the scene, consisting of base container, decorative trim, and
sliding lid component with distinct material properties.Implementation Structure:
Base (Parent Object):
•Rectangular prism (2.5×1.2×5 units) representing the main container
•Textured with aged stone material (diffuse map with wear patterns)
•Decorative gold inlay simulated through additional texture layer with higher specular
values
•Serves as origin for child transformations
Lid (Child Object):
•Slightly larger rectangular prism (2.6×0.4×5.1 units) to create overlap
•Initial position offset by +0.8 units in Y-axis to sit atop base
•Animated translation along local Y-axis when interaction is triggered
•Transformation:M lid=M base·T(0, y offset +y slide,0) wherey slideinterpolates from
0 to 2.5 over interaction duration
Decorative Elements (Grandchildren):
•Corner posts (4 small cylinders, 0.15 radius, 1.5 height)
•Central cartouche (flattened sphere, scaled 1.5×0.2×0.8)
•All inherit both base and lid transformations, moving with lid during interaction
The hierarchical organization ensures that when the lid translates upward, all decora-
tive elements attached to it move together naturally. Material properties differentiate
components: base uses high roughness (0.8) for aged stone appearance, while metallic
decorations use low roughness (0.2) and high metallic factor (0.9) for polished gold effect.

6 Technical Implementation
6.1 Lighting System
The lighting system implements the Phong reflection model with three components:
Ambient:I a=k a·Laprovides base illumination (typically 20% of total)Diffuse:
Id=k d·Ld·max(N·L,0) simulates matte surface reflectionSpecular:I s=k s·Ls·
max(R·V,0)shininesscreates highlights Total illumination:I=I a+I d+I s, calculated
per-fragment for smooth results.
6.2 Shader Programming
Two primary shaders are implemented:Basic Shader:For simple geometry (walls,
floors) with texture mapping and Phong lighting.Normal-Mapped Shader:Extends
basic shader with TBN matrix calculations for detailed surfaces. Both shaders receive
uniform variables for light positions, camera position, and material properties, enabling
dynamic updates without shader recompilation.
6.3 Texture Mapping
All textures are loaded using stb image library and bound to OpenGL texture units.
Mipmaps are automatically generated usingglGenerateMipmap()to prevent aliasing at
distance. Texture coordinates are carefully assigned during geometry construction to
avoid distortion on non-uniform primitives.
7 Conclusion
7.1 Summary
The “Crypt of Thoth” simulation effectively demonstrates fundamental computer graph-
ics concepts including lighting models, hierarchical assembly, shader-based effects, and
interactive camera systems. The project highlights the power of modern OpenGL to
create atmospheric and visually compelling environments using procedurally generated
geometry and carefully crafted textures. Through the implementation of dynamic objects
like swinging traps and interactive sarcophagi, the project showcases not only rendering
techniques but also game development fundamentals such as collision detection, user
input processing, and state management.
7.2 Future Enhancements
The modular structure of the codebase allows for several potential enhancements:
11
•Shadow Mapping:Implementing shadow volumes or shadow maps would dramat-
ically increase visual realism, particularly in torch-lit corridors
•Particle Systems:Adding torch smoke, dust motes, and debris effects would en-
hance atmospheric quality
•Collision Detection:Implementing proper physics-based collision would prevent
wall clipping and enable more complex trap interactions
•Sound Integration:Audio feedback for footsteps, trap mechanisms, and ambient
environment sounds
•Advanced Post-Processing:Bloom effects for torches, depth-of-field for cinematic
moments, and color grading for mood enhancement
The foundation established in this project provides a solid basis for these future expan-
sions while maintaining clean, maintainable code structure.
